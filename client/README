Planet Of Panda

If you want to compile this package yourself, you should take care that you've got the newest packages of:

	-gpc 	The Gnu Pascal Compiler, get latest alpha, otherwise nothing will work.
	-Allegro	You need a WIP version newer than 3.9.34

Also I couldn't setup nice autoconf or automake things because we're using pascal. Also the makefile for cygwin is more or less a hack, because there were several problems with dllimport and gpc alpha.
